## Contents

- [RootMe](https://github.com/rubalsxngh/TryHackMe_Walkthroughs/blob/master/RootMe.md): An easy difficulty CTF challenge that involves exploiting a file upload vulnerability to gain a reverse shell and performing privilege escalation on an executable Python binary.

- [SimpleCTF](https://github.com/rubalsxngh/TryHackMe_Walkthroughs/blob/master/SimpleCTF.md): An easy CTF challenge on TryHackMe, features an FTP anonymous login misconfiguration allowing unauthorized access without credentials. Exploited this to gain an FTP shell, discovered user mitch's file, executed SSH bruteforce, and achieved privilege escalation via vim.

- [Intermediate_Nmap](https://github.com/rubalsxngh/TryHackMe_Walkthroughs/blob/master/Intermediate_Nmap.md): An easy difficulty CTF challenge on TryHackMe. This machine require nmap, netcat skills to gain the machine login username and password further ssh to capture the flag.

- [Blue](https://github.com/rubalsxngh/TryHackMe_Walkthroughs/blob/master/Blue.md): An easy difficulty walkthrough on TryHackMe. This machine suffers with EternalBlue which allows attacker to run arbitrary code on remote machine targetting SMB service running on port 445. When exploited, EternalBlue gives command shell that can be converted into meterpreter shell.

More walkthroughs will be added soon!
