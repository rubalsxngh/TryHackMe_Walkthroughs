### Type: WebApp: Malicious File upload

**Overview**
RootMe is an easy difficulty CTF challenge on TryHackMe. This machine has a file upload vulnerability that allows users to upload files onto the web server. Exploiting this vulnerability, we can gain a reverse shell on the target machine. During the initial exploitation, I used a reverse shell written in PHP. After gaining access, I performed privilege escalation on an executable Python binary.

**Reconnaissance**
* Running Nmap scan
    I used the following Nmap command to perform an initial scan on the target machine:
    
    ``` bash
    nmap -Pn -sC -sV ip-add
    ```

    This command skips the ping check (-Pn), performs version detection (-sV), and runs default scripts (-sC) to gather detailed information about open ports and services on the target machine.

    In the above scan, we find that ports 22 and 80 are open. This indicates that a web application named HackIT is hosted on port 80, running on Apache/2.4.29. The web server is an Ubuntu machine.

* Directory Enumeration
    You can use whatever tool of your arsenel, but the followthrough specied to use gobuster, so I will use gobuster. (will be using dirbuster's medium wordlist)
    
    ``` bash
    gobuster dir -u http://10.10.109.243 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
    ```

    Ahaaaa! We've discovered an /upload directory. The /panel directory also looks promising and warrants further inspection.

* Using curl
    I have performed curl to check what options are enabled on both /uploads and /panel.

    I have nothing suspicous on /uploads but.....

    There is option to upload file on /panel


**Exploitation**

* Upload File

    So, lets upload a php payload onto /panel. The webshell I have choosen is
    
    ```bash
    /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php
    ```

![Failed payload upload](https://i.imgur.com/n199mPa.png)

    When I tried to upload the webshell, It throws an error. It clearly indicated the Content Security Policy( CSP) is set. 

    The server allowed me to upload a png and jpg extension files but we can't execute them in future.

    I have also tried to upload the files by tricking names but nothing seems to work.


    So, it time we fireup the OG, Burpsuite!!

![BurpSuite scan](https://i.imgur.com/V6CJttP.png)

    Using Burp, we can see the server allows us to upload a .php5 extension file, which we can execute and easily get a reverse shell.

* Prepare webshell

    Now, we know we can upload a webshell with .php5 extension, so lets edit couple of paramters in payload.

    In the ip, enter the IP Address of your local machine, to which webshell can call back to and edit the port number you want to listen on to.


* Getting a reverse shell

    Upload the webshell to /panel.

    Run Netcat:

    ``` bash
    nc -nvlp 1234
    ```


    Go to /uploads/ and click onto the uploaded webshell.

    And there you have it!!!

    Run find user.txt file command, what this will do is find the user.txt file in / directory and throws all the errors in /dev/null rather than showing on console:

    ``` bash
    find -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
    ```


**Privelage Escalation**

* Search for Files with SUID permission, which looks weird

    Run the command:

    ``` bash
    find -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
    ```

    what this will do is to seach for files with SUID permission and output all the errors to /dev/null. (Check TryHackMe hint....)

    I found /usr/bin/python as weird file because normal linux system doesnt have it. That means it worth a follow through.

* Search GTFOBins

    Search for python with SUID bin set and run the command given with /usr/bin in front.

* Find the root.txt

    Run command:

    ```bash 
    find -name root.txt 2>/dev/null
    ```

    

**There you have it!!!!**
